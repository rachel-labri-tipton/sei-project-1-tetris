    <h1>About Tetris</h1>

    <p>The original game of Tetris was developed in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, an artificial intelligence researcher at Moscow's Acadamy of  Sciences. Pajitnov would create games to test the strength of new computer hardware. He'd then circulate the games amongst his colleagues. Tetris, a game of stacking configurations of 4 blocks called tetriminoes, was the most popular of these games. It journeyed beyond Moscow and over the Iron Curtain, finding its way to America and eventually my family's first computer in the 90s.
    <br>
    I have a lot of memories playing Tetris growing up. It was always so pleasing just to stack blocks. That's why I wanted to have a go at making my own version of this game: Tetris 2.022. I hope you'll find it fun.  <br> <br> <br>Here is a photo of Alexey Pajitnov back when the game was created: <br> <br> <img src="images/Alexey-Pajitnov-older.jpg"></p>
  
    <h2>How to Play My Game: <br>Tetris 2.022</h2>
    <div>
    <ul>
    <li>Right Arrow = moves a piece right</li>
    <li>Up Arrow = rotates a piece</li>
    <li>Left Arrow = moves a piece left</li>
    <li>Down Arrow & Space Bar = moves a piece down</li>
    <li>Each row of blocks you fill is 100 points.</li>
    <li>I've created 3 levels, so 3 speeds of falling blocks.</li>
    <li>Once you've reached 1000 points at each level, the game prompts you try the next level.</li>
</ul>
     <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
     <p>The Original Theme song, which I provide in the game, is inspired by an old Russian folksong dating back to 1861 called "Korobeiniki" about a traveling peddlar who likes to seduce women.</p>
